# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Frontend Only)

This is a **frontend-only** music player project inspired by Spotify's design and features.  
It is built **entirely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend, no build tools.  
All assets, including the music files and JSON data, are hosted locally alongside the project.
